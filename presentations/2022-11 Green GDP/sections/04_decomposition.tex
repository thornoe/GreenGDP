\section{Growth decomposition}

\begin{frame}{Time series and decomposition of use value of water}
  Aggregate use value of all water environmental services depends on the number of households $N$ in catchment area $v$.\\\medskip
  Sum over all categories $\footnotesize l\in\{\text{groundwater, streams, lakes, coastal waters}\}$:
  \begin{align*}
    \mu_{u,t}^{w}W_t=\sum_v\sum_l\mu_{u,v,t}^{w,l}N_{v,t}
  \end{align*}

  Contributors to growth in the real value of consumption of water environmental services from 1990-2020:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Water quality \textcolor{darkgreen}{$\nearrow$}
    \item Age \textcolor{darkgreen}{$\nearrow$}
    \item Household income \textcolor{darkgreen}{$\nearrow$}
    \item Family patterns \textcolor{darkgreen}{$\nearrow$}
    \item Urbanization \textcolor{red}{$\searrow$}
