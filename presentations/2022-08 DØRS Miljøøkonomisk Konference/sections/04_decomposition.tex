\section{Growth decomposition}

\begin{frame}{Growth decomposition}
  Contributors to growth in the real value of the Danish water quality from 1990-2020:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Water quality \textcolor{darkgreen}{$\nearrow$}
    \item Age \textcolor{darkgreen}{$\nearrow$}
    \item Household income \textcolor{darkgreen}{$\nearrow$}
    \item Family patterns \textcolor{darkgreen}{$\nearrow$}
    \item Urbanization \textcolor{red}{$\searrow$}
  \end{itemize}
  \note{Family patterns: Should decreasing HH size be kept constant?
  \\\bigskip
  total WTP = WTP per household $\times$ number of households
  \\\bigskip
  Intuitively, less couples should rather have a negative effect on total WTP as single adults have lower disposable income.
