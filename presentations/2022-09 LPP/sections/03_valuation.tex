\begin{frame}{Benefit transfer}
  Meta analysis function for benefit transfer of the marginal WTP per year for water quality of category $j$ (streams, lakes, or coastal waters) in catchment area $q$ for a given year:
  \begin{align*}
    \ln \mu_{j,q}^{w}=&\beta_0+.551\ln WQ_{j,q}-.378D_{j}^{lake}-.005SL_{j,q}+.121\ln PSL_{j,q}\\
                        &-.072\ln PAL_q+1.453\ln y_q+.496D_q^{age}
  \end{align*}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[$WQ_{j,q}$] quality of water bodies of category $j$ in $q$ (deviation from "bad")
    \item[$D_{j}^{lake}$] dummy for category $j$ being lakes
    \item[$SL_{j,q}$] shore length of category $j$ in catchment area $q$ (in 1,000 km)
    \item[$PSL_{j,q}$] shore length of category $j$ relative to total shore length in $q$
    \item[$PAL_q$] proportion of agricultural land in catchment area $q$
    \item[$\ln y_q$] average household income in catchment area $q$
    \item[$D_q^{age}$] dummy for mean age of inhabitants in q $\geq$ 45 years
