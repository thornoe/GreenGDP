%       \item Estimated by \textit{multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE)} where a \textit{fully conditional specification (FCS)} is constituted by a conditional density for each year.
%       \item Physical characteristics are included in a \textit{Bayesian ridge regression} using \textit{iteratively-reweighted regularized least-squares}.
