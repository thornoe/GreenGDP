  The quality of ecosystem services has improved from 1990-2020.\\\bigskip
  If $\Delta\text{GNNP}>\Delta\text{NNP}\Rightarrow$ GDP underestimated growth since 1990.\\\bigskip
  \note{\textbf{PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}\\
    Overall, the quality of ecosystem services has improved since 1990. That is likely to be offset by the costs of GHG emissions and the depletion of exhaustable natural resources\\
    - but if it should turn out that $\Delta\text{GNNP}>\Delta\text{NNP}$,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[$\Rightarrow$] then it would indicate that GDP growth has not been at the expense of the environment according to the definition of "strong" sustainability.\\\bigskip
    \end{itemize}
    That is, with reservations that we don't fully live up to our international commitment such as the EU Water Framework Directive and the GHG reduction path implied by the Paris Agreement DESPITE outsourcing of our most polluting factories during the period.
